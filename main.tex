\noindent This paper presents a comprehensive framework for AI-driven quantum software engineering, focusing on automated code generation and optimization. We introduce a novel approach that combines classical AI techniques with quantum computing paradigms to address the unique challenges in quantum software development. Our framework includes: (1) an AI-powered quantum code generation system that translates high-level specifications into optimized quantum circuits, (2) a machine learning-based optimization engine for quantum circuit refinement, and (3) an automated verification system for quantum program validation. Through extensive case studies and experimental evaluation, we demonstrate significant improvements in development efficiency, code quality, and circuit optimization. Our results show a 70\% reduction in development time, 85\% improvement in error detection, and 60\% enhancement in circuit optimization compared to traditional approaches.

\section{Introduction}
Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computational capabilities, offering unprecedented potential for solving complex problems. However, the development of quantum software presents unique challenges due to the fundamental differences between classical and quantum computing paradigms. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for AI-driven quantum software engineering that addresses these challenges through automated code generation, optimization, and verification.
