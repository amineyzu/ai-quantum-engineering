Dear JOSS Editors,

I am submitting our software package "AI-Driven Quantum Software Engineering" for consideration in the Journal of Open Source Software. This submission includes:

1. A complete Python package (`quantum_ai_engineering`) that implements a framework for AI-driven quantum software engineering, focusing on:
   - Natural language to quantum code translation
   - Circuit synthesis and optimization
   - Automated verification and error correction
   - Integration with major quantum computing platforms (IBM Quantum Experience and Google's Cirq)

2. The package is well-documented with:
   - Clear installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - API documentation
   - Test coverage

3. The software is:
   - Open source (MIT License)
   - Available on GitHub: https://github.com/amineyzu/ai-quantum-engineering
   - Properly versioned and packaged
   - Following Python best practices

4. The submission includes:
   - `paper.md` - Main paper content
   - `paper.bib` - Bibliography
   - `paper.html` - Formatted HTML version
   - Complete package structure with all necessary files

The software addresses a significant need in the quantum computing community by providing tools to bridge the gap between classical software engineering practices and quantum computing development. It has been designed to be accessible to both researchers and practitioners in the field.

I have completed the JOSS submission checklist and ensured all requirements are met. The software is ready for review and can be installed via pip.

Thank you for considering our submission.

Best regards,
Mohammed Amine Abdelouareth
