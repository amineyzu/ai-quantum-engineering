# AI-Driven Quantum Software Engineering

An open-source framework for automated quantum code generation and refactoring using artificial intelligence.

## Features

- Natural language to quantum code translation
- Circuit synthesis from functional specifications
- Automatic circuit optimization
- Error correction and fault tolerance
- Comprehensive testing and verification

## Installation

```bash
pip install ai-quantum-engineering
```

## Quick Start

```python
from ai_quantum_engineering import QuantumCodeGenerator

# Initialize the generator
generator = QuantumCodeGenerator()

# Generate quantum circuit from natural language
circuit = generator.generate_circuit(
    "Create a 2-qubit circuit that implements a CNOT gate"
)

# Optimize the circuit
optimized_circuit = generator.optimize_circuit(circuit)

# Verify the circuit
verification_result = generator.verify_circuit(optimized_circuit)
```
