# Summary

This software implements a comprehensive framework for AI-driven quantum software engineering, focusing on automated code generation and optimization. The framework combines classical AI techniques with quantum computing paradigms to address unique challenges in quantum software development. Our implementation provides a robust solution for translating high-level specifications into optimized quantum circuits, significantly reducing development time and improving code quality.

# Statement of need

Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computational capabilities, but developing quantum software presents unique challenges due to the fundamental differences between classical and quantum computing paradigms.
